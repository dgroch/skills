# Component Strategy by Campaign Objective

The hardest part of building a Fig & Bloom email is **not** filling tokens — it is
choosing the components that make the campaign objective *visually obvious* before a
reader has parsed a single word. This file maps campaign objectives to component
choices, sequences, and the things to avoid.

Use it after you have the brief and **before** you write JSON. Always reconcile the
component names here against the live `GET /api/schema` (`components[].name`) — names
are **group-prefixed** (`heroes/…`, `sections/…`, `products/…`, `blocks/…`); only
`header` and `footer` are top-level.

> The live `/api/schema` now also carries per-component **intent metadata**
> (`bestFor`, `avoidFor`, `visualRole`, `tone`) and a top-level `objectives` taxonomy,
> machine-readable mirrors of the playbooks below. `GET /api/examples?objective=<type>`
> returns approved campaign JSON to start from. Validate any draft with
> `POST /api/validate` before saving.

> Brand guardrail (from `brand-voice.md` and the parent Editorial Framework):
> Fig & Bloom does not discount-lead, does not manufacture urgency, and lets craft +
> specificity carry the message. Component choice must honour that — a premium brand
> rarely looks like a clearance email.

## How to choose (the 30-second version)

1. **Name the objective** (taxonomy below). One primary objective per send.
2. **Name the awareness state** — does the reader already know this product/offer, or
   is this the first touch? Cold → lead with emotion/editorial; warm → lead with the
   specific thing.
3. **Pick the OPEN beat** (hero), **AFFIRM beat** (proof/story), **CLOSE beat** (CTA/upsell).
   See the beat/rotation scheme in `SKILL.md` and `manifest.json → variation_rules`.
4. **Check the avoid-list** for the objective. If a chosen component is on it, swap.
5. **Verify above-the-fold CTA** — the primary CTA must render within ~700px (a bare
   `heroes/hero-image-only` does not satisfy this; follow it with a CTA-bearing block).

## Subject line & preview text (per send)

Every send also needs a **`subjectLine`** and a **`previewText`** (inbox preheader) —
this is where opens are won, so treat them as deliverable copy, not an afterthought.

- **Choose the subject from the objective's `subjectPatterns`.** Each objective in
  `GET /api/schema` (`objectives[].subjectPatterns`) carries a short list of on-brand
  starter patterns with `{slot}` placeholders (e.g. `{range}`, `{occasion}`, `{month}`,
  `{product}`). Pick one, fill the slot with the specific thing, and keep the brand
  guardrails (no discount-leading, no manufactured urgency). The pattern lists are **not**
  duplicated here on purpose — read them live from `/api/schema` so this doc never drifts.
- **Write a `previewText`** that complements (never repeats) the subject — a second line
  that extends the promise.
- **Persist both on the saved design.** `subjectLine` and `previewText` are first-class
  metadata fields on the design record: send them in the body of `POST /api/designs`
  (new) or `PUT /api/designs/:id` (update) alongside `name`/`campaign`. They are stored
  with the design and are what `POST /api/klaviyo-draft` falls back to when no override is
  supplied, so the chosen lines must live on the design, not just in chat.

## Objective playbooks

### `farewell_sellthrough` — final weekend / sell-through
**Goal:** move known products without making the range feel like clearance.

**Use**
- OPEN: `heroes/hero-d-clay` (type-forward, dignified) · `blocks/editorial-hero` · restrained `blocks/caption-bar-hero`
- BODY: `sections/body-copy-plain`
- `sections/section-headline` to introduce the line-up
- Equal-weight product cards: `products/card-horizontal` + `products/card-horizontal-reversed` (alternating)
- Quiet "what's next" close: `sections/upsell-noir`

**Avoid:** `blocks/offer-panel`, `sections/promo-code`, discount badges, countdowns, loud urgency language — anything that reads as clearance.

*(Worked example: `RH | 2026-06 Farewell Weekend` — `header → heroes/hero-d-clay → sections/body-copy-plain → sections/section-headline → 7× products/card-horizontal{,-reversed} → sections/upsell-noir → sections/trust-bar → footer`.)*

### `range_launch` — launch / tease
**Goal:** create anticipation and signal design progress.

**Use:** `blocks/editorial-hero` · `blocks/caption-bar-hero` · `blocks/story` · `blocks/feature-list` · `blocks/polaroid-collage` (if strong visual material) · `blocks/image-text` (2/3 image + text, `IMG_SIDE` left/right) · `sections/full-width-image` (a single live full-bleed frame, optional link).
**Avoid:** heavy product grids before the reveal; discount-led modules.

### `product_spotlight`
**Goal:** make one hero product irresistible without a full grid.

**Use:** `blocks/designed-product-card` (badge + serif name/price) **or** `products/card-lifestyle-studio` (lifestyle+studio stack, one per email) · `blocks/image-text` (2/3 image + text & button, `IMG_SIDE` left/right) · `blocks/feature-list` for reasons-to-believe · `sections/full-width-image` (a single live full-bleed frame, optional link) · `sections/testimonial` to close.
**Avoid:** more than one spotlight treatment; dense competing grids.

### `occasion_gifting` — emotional occasion
**Goal:** help the reader express a feeling or mark a moment.

**Use:** `blocks/story` · a softer `blocks/editorial-hero` · `blocks/image-text` (2/3 image + text, `IMG_SIDE` left/right) · `sections/body-copy-plain` · `sections/full-width-image` (a single live full-bleed frame, optional link) · `blocks/polaroid-collage` · `sections/opt-out` early (after hero) for sensitive occasions (Mother's/Father's Day, Valentine's, pregnancy/baby, memorial — see brand-voice sensitivity rules).
**Avoid:** hard urgency; discount framing near sensitive occasions.

### `discount_offer`
**Goal:** make the value clear without damaging the premium feel.

**Use:** `blocks/offer-panel` (the designed offer hero) · `blocks/comparison-vs` · `blocks/feature-list` · `blocks/howto-steps`. For a giveaway, `blocks/offer-panel` in GIVEAWAY MODE (`PROMO_CODE=""`).
**Avoid:** heavily emotional story modules when the objective is rational/value-led; stacking `offer-panel` *and* `sections/promo-code` (pick one); `blocks/image-text` and `sections/full-width-image` (editorial/spotlight modules — not built to carry a price/offer).

### `value_prop`
**Goal:** rational reasons to choose Fig & Bloom.

**Use:** `blocks/feature-list` · `blocks/comparison-vs` · `blocks/image-text` (2/3 image + text & button, `IMG_SIDE` left/right) · `sections/trust-bar` · `sections/three-column-steps-*`.
**Avoid:** emotion-led openers that bury the argument.

### `education_howto`
**Goal:** teach (care / arranging / choosing) — value before the ask.

**Use:** `blocks/howto-steps` (vertical 3-step, photo per step) · `sections/body-copy-plain` · soft single CTA. Compact partner-flow instead → `sections/three-column-steps-*`.
**Avoid:** promo modules up front; making it feel like an ad.

### `social_proof`
**Goal:** borrow customers' confidence.

**Use:** `blocks/polaroid-collage` (scrapbook quotes) · `sections/testimonial` · `products/card-single-testimonial`.
**Avoid:** unbacked superlatives; fake-looking reviews.

### `lifecycle` — welcome / win-back / retention
**Goal:** relationship first, product second.

**Use:** `blocks/story` · `blocks/editorial-hero` · `sections/body-copy-plain` · one gentle product nudge.
**Avoid:** aggressive offers in a welcome; guilt in a win-back.

### `editorial_digest` — recurring editorial digest / monthly newsletter
**Goal:** keep the relationship warm with a recurring "notes from the studio" edition —
the studio's voice and a single bloom to discover, never a sale.

**Worked beat order** (matches the schema's `blockSequence` for `editorial_digest` —
confirm against `GET /api/schema`):

```
header → blocks/caption-bar-hero → blocks/story → sections/section-headline
       → products/card-horizontal → sections/upsell-noir → sections/trust-bar → footer
```

A photo-led `caption-bar-hero` opener (CTA in the caption bar, above the fold) → a founder
`story` beat → a `section-headline` to introduce the month's pick → **one** product card →
a soft `upsell-noir` closing beat.

**Use:** `blocks/caption-bar-hero` (opener) · `blocks/editorial-hero` (alt opener) ·
`blocks/story` · `blocks/polaroid-collage` (proof / montage) · a single `products/card-horizontal` ·
`blocks/journal-tile` (a "From the Journal" row of 2–3 linked posts — after products, before upsell).
**Avoid:** `blocks/offer-panel`, `sections/promo-code`, `sections/delivery-cutoffs` — a digest
is editorial, not promotional. No discount-leading and no manufactured deadlines.

> **`blocks/journal-tile` intent** (mirrors `COMPONENT_INTENT` / live-schema `bestFor`+`avoidFor`)
> — bestFor: `editorial_digest`, `lifecycle`, `social_proof`; avoidFor: `discount_offer`,
> `occasion_gifting`. A "From the Journal" row of 2–3 linked article tiles. Live HTML
> (per-tile links). Editorial only — no price field. Use instead of product cards when linking
> blog posts.

> **`blocks/image-text` intent** (mirrors `COMPONENT_INTENT` / live-schema `bestFor`+`avoidFor`)
> — bestFor: `product_spotlight`, `range_launch`, `value_prop`, `occasion_gifting`; avoidFor:
> `discount_offer`. requiresImage: true; imageRatio: `400x500 (4:5)`. role: 2/3 image + text &
> button, `IMG_SIDE` flips the image left/right. Designed block — sliced to PNG. One per email.

> **`sections/full-width-image` intent** (mirrors `COMPONENT_INTENT` / live-schema `bestFor`+`avoidFor`)
> — bestFor: `range_launch`, `product_spotlight`, `editorial_digest`, `occasion_gifting`; avoidFor:
> `discount_offer`. requiresImage: true; imageRatio: `any (600 wide, natural height)`. role: single
> full-width image, live HTML, optional link. NOT sliced — keeps its own click-through and animated GIF.

**Recurring-edition naming convention:** name each edition
`EDM | {YYYY-MM} {Edition Name}` (e.g. `EDM | 2026-06 In Bloom`) so a series sorts
chronologically and reads as one ongoing publication.

**Rotation note (series discipline):** because the skeleton is fixed, vary the *art
direction* so consecutive editions don't feel same-y — **consecutive editions must not
repeat the same `(open_block, palette)` pair** (and ideally vary the composition levers
too — `ROTATION` / `TYPE_SCALE` / `DENSITY` — per `manifest.json → components.variation_rules`).
Track the previous edition's open block + palette and pick a different combination.
